The actual code was only written after a week of studying the C# language. I worked with Classes, Delegates, Generics, LINQ, Collections, Open Source Libraries, Asynchronous Methods, and OOP Concepts.\n\n**Basic TCP Socket Programming in C#:** System.Net and System.Net.Sockets were utilized here. My goal was to respond to web requests without a true web server running, and this method accomplished that.\n\n**Visual Studio 2019:** The last version of Visual Studio I used was 2005. Learning the improvements and relearning how to debug and step through the code with VS was very valuable.",
