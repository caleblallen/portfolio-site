    "intro": "As part of the Computer Science program at CSU: Monterey Bay, my team was required to create a Capstone application. We came up with Spottr, a social network designed for photographers to share scenic locations on a map for other photographers to see. Our design goals for Spottr were: ",
    "goals": ["Create an intuitive interface where users could discover new scenic locations near them.",
      "Enabled the user to upload, tag, and explore photos.",
      "Create a Progressive Web App to handle both mobile and desktop experiences from a single codebase."]

  "postMortem": "Spottr was a large project. A team of three worked on it for twelve weeks in between instructional requirements.<br> <br> ***Note:*** This project won the *Capstone of the Year* award for our CSUMB cohort. Projects were voted on by other students and editorial decisions were made by professors in the program.<br> <br> Project Takeaways:<br> <br> **Team and Pair Programming:** This was was a large project and the team had to work with, and depend upon. each other. We had weekly SCRUM meetings to touch base on what progress we needed to make each week. The primary skill I learned here was to take on the *hardest* task I could reasonably complete during the next sprint. Doing so drove me into a highly industrious state of mind.<br> **Amazon Web Service:** We hosted our app on the *Elastic Beanstalk*, our database was on Amazon's *Relational Database System*, and our photos were stored on *S3 Storage*.  We integrated with AWS throughout development and we had a highly scalable backend by the end.<br> **Google Maps API:** The map was key to our product. Integration with Google Maps was a large focus of our team.<br> **Progressive Web Apps:** We implemented a Progressive Web App for Spottr. The intention was to host an app and website with the same codebase. This worked, but I believe PWA is likely the wrong choice for a project like Spottr. Interacting with the user through the browser requires too much user involvement for full functionality. It should just work for them.",
